The UX Research team wants to see a distribution of watch durations. They want the result to contain:

duration, which is the watch event duration, rounded to the closest minute
count, the number of watch events falling into this “bucket”
Your result should look like:

duration	count
1.0	        9
2.0	        21
3.0	        19
…	          …

Use COUNT(), GROUP BY, and ORDER BY to create this result and order this data by increasing duration.

SELECT ROUND(watch_duration_in_minutes) AS 'duration',
   COUNT(*) AS 'count'
FROM watch_history
GROUP BY duration
ORDER BY duration ASC;
